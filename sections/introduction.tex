- features of today's smartphones 
 - cameras able to take high resolution pictures/videos

- uses location of user to identify Pokemon/Events/special places near him
- able to use AR to interact with Pokemon in real world 
- (always) connected to the internet and able to transfer data, no opt-out

- tracking of location and movement (further analysis could discover certain habits/patterns)
- analysis of everything where persons points their camera at: texts, faces, brands
