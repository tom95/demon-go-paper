% - Irgendwas zu Sensibilisierung gegnüber möglichem Datenklau
As we have demonstrated, a system that continuously spies on the user while they are playing an augmented reality game is feasible to build, especially with the prospect of our employed frameworks being continuously improved. We also showed how a preprocessing on the client allows reducing the amount of data that is actually communicated to the server to a minimum, thus disguising the illicit behavior from the user. Even though a close analysis of the traffic of the application may reveal surprisingly frequent communication with a server, a more elaborate gameplay system incorporating real-time player-vs-player might be able to sell this as necessary as well.

As such, we believe that augmented reality applications can pose a great risk to the consumer. % now do the positive turn and tell them  how to fix it!



% Future Work
- Move away from contour-based region of interest recognition and aggregate 
- z.B. weitere Daten sammeln und komplexere Nutzerprofile anlegen
- Data Analytics auf den gesammelten Infos
