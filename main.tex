\section{Gameplay Implementation}
\label{sec:gameplay_implementation}
% - game uses AR to capture demons; involves getting idea about the location, correlating it to 2D frames that are analyzed by pipeline
In this section, we will outline the implementation of Demon GO.
We will first describe how the advanced gameplay elements for player vs player interactions are handled, then demonstrate how the augmented reality component allows players to capture demons, and then move on to the data exploitation subsystem.
Snapshots from the augmented reality component form the bridge between the game and the exploitation subsystems.
The exploitation subsystem consists of a light weight image processing pipeline on the player's phone and a server component for heavier processing.

\subsection{Map View}
- using MapBox to display an interactive map of the augmented world with markers at the positions of stashes (different colors for own and hostile stashes) with their perimeter/range of influence
- for own stashes the user also sees icons for every demon he placed to defend the stash 

- markers are pinned by geo-location on the map

\subsection{Storing and syncing stash data}
- need to easily sync the current game state (players, stashes, demons) across multiple clients on different devices

- using document-based NoSQL-database Google Firestore (cloud hosting, synced state across clients, easy setup) --> current flagship database of Google for mobile app development

- document hierarchy: player id --> stashes/null stash --> demons for stash (everything indexed by id)

- App implements change listeners for the collections of stashes and demons --> depending on what type of event happened stash/demon markers on the map (ideally only nearby) need to be redrawn
--> updated after every fight and every placement of a demon onto a stash

- demons that the player didn't place at a stash are saved in the player's "null-stash" which is not saved in the collection of stashes (as it does not need to be synced with the other players)
- updated when new demon was summoned or captured and after every fight in which the attacking demon lost health points

\subsection{Demon fights}

- the current implementation is a simulation that follows a round-based approach. In every round the attacking demon assaults one defending demon and afterwards gets assaulted by every defending demon sequentially. Thereby both the order in which the defenders are attacked by the attacker and the order in which the defenders counter-attack the attacking demon are shuffled once in advance of the fight. 

- makes the fight more unpredictable and harder for the attacker to guess which demons he might eliminate. After a fight both users are informed about the result (using Android Toast/Push Notification) and the health points of the surviving demons are updated in the corresponding Google Firestore documents.

- as users can currently add an unlimited amount of demons to a stash the defense of a stash gets exponentially stronger the more demons the defender places on them

- in a future version: defender can interactively intervene in the fight and dynamically add more defenders to the stash -> therefore fight must obviously take a while

% FIXME intro to OpenCV, features, usages?
- pipeline which processes every frame (captured by camera while capturing demons) on phone
- preselect frames which are sent to server
- only best should get sent
- pipeline consists of independent steps which could be ordered in any order -> same interface
- frames are wrapped in \textit{Snapshots} (ensures that the same object is passed between steps)

\subsection{Snapshots / Communication with Pipeline}
% FIXME in parts dupl with ARCore.Snapshots above -- might be fine if we focus on the pipeline-specific aspects
- holds OpenCV Mat (represents frame) and score (calculated in steps)
- also able to convert Mat to base64 and make a parameter list out of attributes (both for sending) 

- AR-Snapshots: additional fields (points in room and viewProjectionMatrix)

\subsection{Steps}
- contain list of following steps (in next)
- able to track time of execution
- .start(snap) -> .process(snap) -> .output(snap) (starts all steps in next with processed snapshots)

- special case: \textit{StepWithQueue}
- additional priority queue based on snapshot score
- getBestAndClear (angleChange) and getBest (sendingStep)
- used in angleChange and sendingStep where the only the best frame should be handled/should be handled first

 \subsubsection{Blur Estimation}
 The Blur Estimation is needed to preselect snapshots whose quality is sufficient for further processing. 
 The frame of the snapshot, which is processed, will be converted to a grayscale image before the Laplace operator is applied to it.
 Afterwards the variance of the new image will be calculated and will indicate the blurriness where a higher variance will represent a sharper image.
 The idea behind this approach is that a blurry image (because of its nature) is less likely to have a lot of clear edges. 
 Therefore the variance of the Laplace operator, which is used to detect edges, will be lower than in a sharp picture. 
 
 \subsubsection{AngleChange}
 
\subsubsection{Brand/Pattern Recognition}
- Utilizes keypoint detection and feature descriptor matching to match recognizable patterns like brand logos and letterings \\
- The ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) technique is used \cite{rublee2011orb} \\
- Computationally expensive step is keypoint calculation for frame.\\
-> Comparison with large number of patterns possible, as their keypoints can be precalculated.\\
- 'cheaper' than neural network, especially on mobile devices\\
- much better results than template matching

\end{figure*}
\textbf{Contour Detection: } \hfill \\
As a starting point to check areas of the incoming frame for potentially sensitive information, we detect contours in the scene.
We reason that this information can most likely be found in areas discernible from the rest of the frame, for example a piece of paper.
The frame is preprocessed in several steps to maximize recognizable contours:
First, we apply a Gaussian Blur with a small kernel to reduce image noise, and then apply a bilateral filter to smooth the image further while keeping edges intact.
Afterwards, a Canny edge filter with a dynamic threshold is applied to binarize the frame.
The result of this preprocessing can be found in figure~\ref{fig:cont_dect1}.
On this image, we run a contour detection algorithm provided by OpenCV to retrieve a list of contours.
Contours with a small size beneath a fixed threshold are culled from this list to further sort out \enquote{scene noise} like the numerous objects on the left side of the desk.
The outlines of these contours are approximated by polygons for which the deviation epsilon is based on the contour's area.
Once again we sort out polygons with more than seven edges to reduce our set of candidates.
All contours with a large enough area can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:cont_dect3}. Those with simple enough approximations are colored green.
We can see that from the complex original scene, only three areas of the image remain.
However, one potentially interesting area in the foreground is left out and will thusly not be considered in later steps of the pipeline.
Each selected contour is cropped from the image and will be passed forward to the next step.
% \subsubsection{Noise Estimation}

\textbf{Noise Estimation: } \hfill \\
To determine which of the found contours are likely to contain (textual) information, we first calculate a noise measure.
We use a simple kernel for fast noise variance estimation proposed by Immerkaer \cite{immerkaer1996fast}.
The author notes that \enquote{In highly textured images or regions, though,
the noise estimator perceives thin lines as noise}.
We utilize this property of the estimator as a criterium for the detection of small, dense text.
Areas with a low noise value are discarded in this step.
It is, however, completely plausible that high-noise contours do not contain text.
The score of the snapshot is multiplied with the noise value, and if the noise threshold is passed, the snapshot is passed on to the next step.

\textbf{Colorfulness Estimation: } \hfill \\
To further preselect the remaining contours, we estimate the colorfulness of the image regions.
A fast method for this is proposed by Hasler, meant to be used as an overall colorfulness estimation of a natural scene.~\cite{hasler2003measuring}.
We presume that regions of legible text are usually low in color variance to increase the contrast between letters and background.
Regions with high color variance are therefore not passed forwards to the next step.
The score is once again multiplied with the colorfulness value.
In practice, contours with a high amount of noise and a low color variance are good estimates for regions of the image that actually contain text.

\subsection{Communication between phone and server}

After a snapshot was processed in the pipeline it is added to the priority queue of the sending step where all snapshots are ordered by their calculated score.
The transmission itself is handled by \textit{Volley} a fast Android networking library.
Every 0.5s a POST-request will be prepared including the base64 encoded frame of the best snapshot in the priority queue and the id of the player. 
After being added to the request queue of Volley, the request will then be sent to the server as soon as possible.

Additionally every 100th frame, which enters the pipeline will be added to the queue of the sending step directly after passing the blur estimation and angle change step.
This ensures that once in a while a data sent to the server if no other snapshot has a sufficient score after passing the other steps.
The score generation, however, guarantees that this very rarely the case.

% Direct sending after brand detection

\subsection{Server-side Analysis}

- Flask/Flask-SocketIO server with sqllite db
- decodes received images and writes them to the disk (for now)
- detects where possible text is written on saved image
- crops image for every box \& saves it
- analyses rotaion of text, removes rotation and runs pytesseract on it 
- saves user\_id, filename of cropped img, analysed text, rotation, timestamp and confidence of analysis (given by pytesseract) to db
- also informs the frontend (?) about added and processed images via SocketIO
